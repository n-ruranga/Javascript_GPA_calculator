    return (totalPoints / assignments.length).toFixed(2);
}
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
const assignment = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Math Quiz 1",
    grade: 4.5,
    dateAdded: "12/8/2024"
};
```

```javascript
function saveToStorage() {
    const dataToSave = {
        assignments: assignments,
        assignmentIdCounter: assignmentIdCounter,
        lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    localStorage.setItem('gpaCalculatorData', JSON.stringify(dataToSave));
}
```
